# 🛠️ RedisLite – A Redis-like Key-Value Store

**RedisLite** is a lightweight, in-memory key-value store inspired by [Redis](https://redis.io/). Built for learning and experimentation, it supports basic key-value operations, TTL (time-to-live), persistence, and simple concurrency. Perfect for developers and students who want to understand how modern in-memory databases work under the hood.

## 🔹 Features

- **In-Memory Storage:** Ultra-fast key-value operations using efficient data structures.
- **Persistence:** Optional snapshot-based or append-only file persistence to save your data.
- **TTL Support:** Automatically expire keys after a specified time.
- **Data Types:** Strings, Lists, and Hash-like structures (basic).
- **Concurrency Safe:** Thread-safe operations for multi-threaded applications.
- **Simple CLI Interface:** Interact with the store via a command-line interface.
- **Easy API Integration:** Simple methods to integrate in Python/Java projects.
